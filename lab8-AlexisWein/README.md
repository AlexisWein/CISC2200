In this lab, I completed the "listIntersection" and "listUnion" functions in the SortedLList.h class. 
The listIntersection function takes two sorted linked lists as parameters and returns a sorted list of items they have in common. 
The listUnion function also takes two sorted linked lists as parameters and returns a sorted list of all the items. Duplicate items only appear once.
