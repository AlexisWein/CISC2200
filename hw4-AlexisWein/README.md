In this assignment, I completed two implementations of sorted lists, one with a sorted Array List (SortedAList.h) and one with a sorted Linked List (SortedLList.h). 
In part 1 of the assignment, I implemented the putElement function in SortedAList.h and SortedLList.h. 
In part 2 of the assignment, I finished the findInsertPosition function in find.cpp using a binary search algorithm based on pseudocode from Wikipedia my professor said we could refer to. 
Link.h is the link node class for linked lists and SortedList.h is the base class for the sorted list ADT.
