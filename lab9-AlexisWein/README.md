The purpose of this lab was to become familiar with binary search trees. I completed the "find," "remove," and "printLevelbyLevel" functions in the BST.h class. 
The "find" function takes an element as a parameter and returns true if that element is in the binary search tree, and false if it is not. 
The "remove" function takes an element as a parameter and removes it from the BST if it is there; if it is not, it returns and does nothing. 
The printLevelByLevel function is based on preorder traversal and prints the BST level by level.
