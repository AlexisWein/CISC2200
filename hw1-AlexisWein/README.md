This is the first homework assignment I completed in Data Structures (CISC2200). 
The instructions for this assignment were to write code to reverse an array (Part 1), and to compute the running sum of the array (Part 2). 
I wrote code for the reversal in the 'main_rev.cpp' function and code for the running sum in the main_rsum.cpp file.
