In this lab, I completed the "combine" and "permute" functions in solution.cpp. 
The "combine" function returns all possible combinations of k numbers given numbers 1 through n. 
For example, for n = 3 and k = 2, the output should be [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]. 
The "permute" function returns all possible permutations of numbers 1 through n. 
For example, for n = 3, the output should be [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], etc.
